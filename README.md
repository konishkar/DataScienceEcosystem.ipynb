In this notebook, Data Science tools and ecosystem are summarized.

Objectives:

List popular languages for Data Science
List popular libraries for Data Science
List some development environment open source tools used in Data Science
Demonstrate some basic arithmetic expressions in Python
Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

Python
R
SQL
Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

Pandas and NumPy for scientific computing in Python
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization in Python
Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for machine learning and deep learning in Python
ggplot2, Plotly, Lattice, and Leaflet for data visualization in R
dplyr and stringr for data and string manipulation in R
caret for machine learning in R
Data Science Tools
Jupyter Notebook
Visual Studio Code
R Studio
Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply and then add integers
